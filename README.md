# Healing Helper
With this mod instead of spactating when you die, you will now be turned into a healing drone until the match is complete. You can heal your surviving teammates, pickup items from the boss, and even purchase items from chests. If playing multiplayer the server host must have the mod installed, and it will work for all players in the match.
